    <h1>
    A page with some divs and spans
    </h1>
    <p>
    This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".
        <br>
        This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.

    <hr>
    <p>
        This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span> <span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span> because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        One the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
    </p>

<div>
    This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.
