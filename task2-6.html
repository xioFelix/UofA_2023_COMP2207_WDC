    <h1>
        Check out my borders
    </h1>
    <p>
     We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other elements can have borders too, <span class="redborder">like this span with the class red-border</span>.
    </p>
<hr>
    <p>
        You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;<br>
        all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span><br>
        That prevents if from messing with the line height.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Notice how the borders double up here:
